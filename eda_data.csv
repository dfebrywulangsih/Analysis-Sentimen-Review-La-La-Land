"Part of me acknowledges the irony of creating a film about “daring to dream” within Hollywood, the most restrictive, exclusive, unwelcoming system of any artistic medium.

"[5] Neither outstanding nor horrid. It seems rather puzzling, though, that so much of the project rests on Emma Stone's shoulders. She is a fine actress, particularly adept with comedy, but as Mia she is a mediocre singer and a subpar dancer.
